# Turtle Crossing Game 🐢🚗

A simple arcade-style game built using Python's Turtle Graphics library.

This project was developed as part of my progress through the **100 Days of Code** course.

## 🎮 How to Play

Help the turtle safely cross the road and avoid getting hit by the speeding cars!

- Press **↑ Up Arrow** to move the turtle forward.
- Each successful crossing increases your level—and the cars get faster!
- Colliding with a car ends the game.
